## SWIRRL PROV Templates

Just a few examples of PROV Templates used in SWIRRL [1] to record provenance associated with the resources managed via the SWIRRL Virtual Rsearch Environment API (Workflows, Notebooks, Visualisation tools).

SWIRRL is used in several contexts. It is available to users of  [Climate4Impact](https://climate4Impact.eu) [2], to obtain analysis workspaces for CMIP5/CMIP6 data that are interactively fetched from ESGF.
