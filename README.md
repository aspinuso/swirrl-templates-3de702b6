## SWIRRL PROV Templates

Here are a few examples of PROV Templates used in SWIRRL [1] to record provenance associated with resources managed via the SWIRRL Virtual Research Environment (VRE) API, including Workflows, Notebooks, and Visualization tools.

SWIRRL is used in various contexts. It is available to users of  [Climate4Impact](https://climate4Impact.eu) [2], to provide analysis workspaces for CMIP5/CMIP6 data, which are interactively fetched from ESGF.
